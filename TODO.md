# TODO - Feature Ideas

## Planned Features

- Chat integration allowing players to send Direct Messages to any individual player
- Chat integration for a full forum message board allowing all players to collaborate in one chat
- Roll integration allowing players to roll any sided dice with an animation, broadcasing to the full chat


## Bugs / Fixes

- When DM is moving a character in 2D change the hand to be a grabbing hand
- When DM is moving a character in 2D, map should stay stationary and only character should move
- DM Motion gesture should not exceed bounds of map

## Ideas / Nice-to-Have

- Map creator function for Dungeon master allowing the DM to create their own maps, drawing walls
- Image Integration allowing a DM to upload an image and having a function be able to turn it into a grid based map effectively becoming the "floor" of the 3D map.
- Movement speed and distance integrator
    - Have squares marked as a ceratin distance.  Allow a player to input movement speed/run action
    - Only allow character to move within specific distance of movement speed
